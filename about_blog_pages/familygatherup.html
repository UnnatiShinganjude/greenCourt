            As everyone settled in, the aroma of delicious Indian cuisine wafted through the air, igniting appetites and setting the stage for a delightful culinary journey. Our attentive staff served a selection of appetizers, including crispy samosas and flavorful paneer tikka, which were met with enthusiastic approval from both adults and children.
