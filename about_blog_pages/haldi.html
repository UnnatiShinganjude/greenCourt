At Hotel Green Court's Restaurant, we recently had the honor of hosting a lively and heartwarming Haldi ceremony that filled our venue with joy, color, and tradition. From the moment guests arrived, there was a palpable sense of excitement as family and friends gathered to celebrate this cherished pre-wedding ritual.

Our team welcomed everyone with refreshing drinks and light appetizers, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere. The venue was beautifully decorated in shades of yellow and gold, with marigold garlands and vibrant drapes adorning the space, setting the perfect backdrop for the festivities. Every detail was meticulously arranged to honor the significance of this joyous occasion.<br><br>

As the ceremony began, the bride and groom, dressed in traditional yellow attire, were seated in a beautifully adorned area, ready to receive blessings from their loved ones. Laughter and smiles filled the air as family members applied turmeric paste to the couple, a ritual symbolizing purity and good fortune. The ceremony was infused with love, as everyone participated in the age-old tradition, blessing the couple with happiness and prosperity.

Our chefs prepared a delicious spread for the guests, offering an array of light snacks and beverages to keep the energy high throughout the event. From crispy pakoras and refreshing chaat to cooling beverages like lassi and nimbu pani, the flavors were a perfect match for the vibrant celebration.<br><br>

Following the ceremony, guests gathered for a buffet lunch, featuring a selection of delectable dishes from Hotel Green Court's Indian menu. Our culinary team crafted a delightful menu that included aromatic pulao, flavorful paneer curries, and fresh naan, ensuring there was something for everyone to enjoy. The food not only satisfied the appetites of the guests but also added to the festive spirit of the event.

As music played softly in the background, children ran around happily, and families gathered in small groups, sharing stories and celebrating the couple. The intimate yet lively atmosphere made the event feel even more special, and the joy in the room was contagious.<br><br>
